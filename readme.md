# go-glx/vgl

VGL is vulkan graphics library

__NOT READY FOR ANY REAL USAGE YET (IN DEV)__

---

Its primitive 2D-only graphics library for drawing simple staff like circles, boxes, lines, polygons and textures.

Also support custom SPIR-V shaders

This library use Vulkan for sending GPU commands.

## Usage

This library can be used in high performance and rich graphic
applications. (2D Game engines)

3D not supported right now

## Arch

```
vgl -> driver -> GPU
                  |
                  WM
```

Available drivers:
- vulkan

Available WM:
- glfw
- SDL (todo)

Available GPUs:
- any discrete/integrated/dual(optimus) GPU with shader v1+ support

## Current state of dev

Basic triangles rendering:
![example](./example/triangles.png)
